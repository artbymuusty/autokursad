# side that actually starts PX4+Gazebo) never set it, leaving it to whatever
# gz-transport auto-selects on this host. On a machine with more than one
# active network interface that can put the simulator and the Python tooling
# on different discovery paths, so gz_bridge/camera_service never see each
# other's topics even though both are genuinely running. Pin it here too so
# every process in the chain agrees.
#
# GZ_PARTITION matters for the same reason and was the actual macOS blocker:
# gz-transport's DEFAULT partition is "<hostname>:<username>", and this Mac's
# hostname is DHCP/reverse-DNS derived, so it changes with the network. The
# sim and anything launched later ended up in different partitions and never
# discovered each other. Both values now come from one shared file used by the
# sim, mission and camera launchers alike.

# verify-idle gate below (same unanchored pattern) then reports FATAL and
# exits WITHOUT starting the simulator, which is the most likely reason

# matched it. Confirmed directly: a gz-sim server PID survived multiple
# consecutive runs of this script, each one printing "Pre-launch invariants
# met" while that same already-running (and, in one investigation, already
# crashed/toppled) world and vehicle model kept being reused underneath every
# supposedly-fresh PX4 relaunch. "gz sim" (space) matches the real dispatcher

# this, each after ~3 minutes of futile waiting; commanding HOLD clears it
# in about 2 seconds. This lives here, in the launcher/hygiene layer,
# deliberately: it is a rig-reset concern, not mission logic, and the
# mission must never quietly re-arm a vehicle an operator left in LAND.

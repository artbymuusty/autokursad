"""D2c: one contour must not commit as two classes.

Measured over 1741 live frames on 2026-08-17: 122 of them emitted
KIRMIZI_DIKDORTGEN *and* KIRMIZI_UCGEN together, from the SAME single red
blob -- identical area distributions (median 512 px2 in both sets), 3
vertices at eps 0.03, and not one touching the frame edge. No frame in the
entire flight contained more than one red or more than one blue blob, so
the payload contributed nothing: the arena triangle was committing as a
rectangle as well as a triangle, and Görev 3's pickup target IS a rectangle.

The cause is two shape gates sweeping different eps ranges over one
contour: 3 vertices over the triangle's 0.03-0.09, 4 over the rectangle's
tighter 0.02-0.06 where a rounded corner splits in two.

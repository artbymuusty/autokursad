"""
ADR-004 §10 (Health Model). Health is computed purely from event timestamps
and declared cadences -- subsystems don't self-report "I am healthy," they
just keep publishing on schedule. Going silent IS the signal, so a frozen
detector (e.g. YoloDetector never loading its model) becomes visible the
same way a crashed one would, instead of looking identical to "no targets
in view" (the exact blind spot ADR-004 §8/§9.2 identified).

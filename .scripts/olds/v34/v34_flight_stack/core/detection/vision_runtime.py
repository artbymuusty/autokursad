"""ADR-010 P3: the vision pipeline, owned for the whole MISSION rather than
for the duration of Görev 2.

Why this file exists -- measured on the V1''' run (mission_81cfefe66ad7):

    VISION_FRAME_PROCESSED: 2185 events, 9.35 Hz, worst gap 0.13 s,
    ZERO gaps > 1.5 s ... and then the last one at t=236.3 s, which is
    exactly the instant of GOREV2_COMPLETE -> GOREV3_START. No frames at
    all for the remaining 64.7 s of a 301 s flight.

Both loops used to live in Gorev2Orchestrator.run(), started at its top and
cancelled in its `finally`. So while Görev 2 ran the feed was healthy --
that part of ADR-008 B1 worked exactly as designed -- but the moment Görev 2
returned, the frame grabber and the detector died with it. Three consequences,
all of which showed up in that run:

  1. The dashboard froze on its last frame for the rest of the flight: the
     camera panel keeps rendering whatever FrameChannel last received, and
     nothing was publishing any more.
  2. Görev 3's own descent centering got 0 committed detections out of 200
     attempts (first miss already at 3.03 m) and could only time out --
     it was reading a feed whose producer no longer existed.
  3. Gorev3PickupPhase held a direct reference to the detector and called
     detect() itself, which is the SECOND-caller problem ADR-008 B1 exists
     to prevent: HSVContourDetector's per-shape streak state is only
     coherent when exactly one caller feeds it one frame sequence.

So the invariant ADR-008 B1 established -- "exactly one detect() caller,
running unconditionally" -- was right, but scoped to the wrong lifetime.
Here it is scoped to the mission: started before the master FSM runs and
stopped after it finishes, so every phase (Görev 2, Görev 3, return, land)
consumes the same single-owner feed and the display never stops.

Nothing about the loops themselves changed -- cadence, throttled logging,
failure escalation, the busy-spin fix and the deliberate "do not publish on
failure, let the feed age out" rule are all carried over verbatim.

    Görev 3's phases take an IDetector because IPayloadVisibilityStrategy is
    written against that interface. Handing them the real detector makes
    them a second detect() caller, which is exactly what corrupts
    HSVContourDetector's per-shape streak state -- so they get this instead:
    same interface, but every call returns whatever the one real caller
    (VisionRuntime._detection_loop) most recently published.

    `frame` is accepted and ignored, deliberately. The frame a caller
    happens to hold is not the frame the streak logic was advanced on, and
    re-running detect() on it is the bug. Freshness still applies: if the
